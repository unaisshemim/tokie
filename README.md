## 🧩 <span style="color:#2196F3">The Problem</span>
ChatGPT has a limit on how much it can "remember" in a single conversation. It’s not about how long the chat looks — it’s about tokens. Tokens are chunks of words, and once a session reaches the limit (like 128,000 tokens for GPT-4), things start breaking:

- ❌ <span style="color:#F44336">It stops remembering earlier parts of your chat.</span>
- ❌ <span style="color:#F44336">Answers get confusing or off-topic.</span>
- ❌ <span style="color:#F44336">You lose context, continuity, and quality.</span>

The problem?
You never know when you're about to hit that limit.
