## 🧩 <span style="color:#2196F3">The Problem</span>
ChatGPT has a limit on how much it can "remember" in a single conversation. It’s not about how long the chat looks — it’s about tokens. Tokens are chunks of words, and once a session reaches the limit, things start breaking:

- ❌ <span style="color:#F44336">It stops remembering earlier parts of your chat.</span>
- ❌ <span style="color:#F44336">Answers get confusing or off-topic.</span>
- ❌ <span style="color:#F44336">You lose context, continuity, and quality.</span>

The problem?  
You never know when you're about to hit that limit.

## 📊 <span style="color:#4CAF50">GPT-5 Context Window Limits (August 2025)</span>

The **context window** is how much information ChatGPT can process at once. Once you pass the limit, it starts forgetting earlier messages.

| Tier             | Token Limit        | Approx. Word Count | Notes |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------|
| Free             | ~8,000 tokens      | ~6,000 words       | Shorter sessions; large inputs may need summarizing or splitting. |
| Plus             | ~32,000 tokens     | ~24,000 words      | Great for longer chats and bigger uploads, but still capped below Pro/Enterprise. |
| Pro / Enterprise | 128,000+ tokens    | 96,000+ words      | API access can reach up to 400,000 tokens per request. |

**Key Takeaways:**
- Free users hit the wall fast with longer projects.
- Plus offers 4× the space, ideal for heavy research or extended creative work.
- For truly massive contexts, you’ll need Pro, Enterprise, or API access.
